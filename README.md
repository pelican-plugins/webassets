This [Pelican](https://github.com/getpelican/pelican) plugin allows you to use
the [webassets][] module to perform a number
of useful asset management functions on your web site, such as:

* CSS minification (`cssmin`, `yui_css`, ...)
* CSS compiling (`less`, `sass`, ...)
* JS building (`uglifyjs`, `yui_js`, `closure`, ...)

Some other interesting abilities of [webassets][] include:

* [URL Expiry or
  "cache-busting"](https://webassets.readthedocs.io/en/latest/expiring.html),
  allowing you to set the cache headers for your assets long into the
  future, saving bandwidth and reducing page load-times
* a [`spritemapper`](https://yostudios.github.io/Spritemapper/) function to
  automatically combine multiple icons into one large image with corresponding
  position slices
* a `datauri` function to minimize the number of HTTP requests by
  replacing `url()` references in your stylesheets with internal
  in-line [data URIs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_URI_scheme)

For the complete list of what [webassets][] can do, check out the **included
filters** section in the [webassets
documentation](https://webassets.readthedocs.io/en/latest/builtin_filters.html).

## Installation

Getting started with [webassets][] couldn't be easier thanks to `pip`:

```shell-session
python -m pip install pelican-webassets
```

For more detailed plugin installation instructions, please refer to the
[Pelican Plugin Documentation](https://docs.getpelican.com/en/latest/plugins.html).

ðŸ’¡ **Keep in Mind:** Each function you use in your `{% asset filters %}`
arguments (more on this later) will need to be installed
separately. For example, if you wanted to use the `libsass` filter, you
will need to `pip install libsass`. You can even [create a custom
filter](https://webassets.readthedocs.io/en/latest/custom_filters.html)
if you wanted.

## Usage

With the plugin installed, include one or more `{% assets %}` tags
into your web site's templates to generate everything your web page will
need. For example, something like this in your templateâ€¦

```html+jinja
{% assets filters="libsass,cssmin", output="css/style.min.css", "css/style.scss" %}
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="{{SITEURL}}/{{ASSET_URL}}">
{% endassets %}
```

â€¦Â will tell [webassets][] to use `libsass` and `cssmin` to compile and
minify the `css/style.scss` file in your theme, and save the compiled
stylesheet as `css/style.min.css` in the output of your finished
website, along with the `link` element like this in your web page:

```html+jinja
<link href="{SITEURL}/{THEME_STATIC_DIR}/css/style.min.css?b3a7c807" rel="stylesheet">
```

ðŸŒ  **The More You Know:** The `ASSET_URL` variable is the concatenation
of your Pelican `THEME_STATIC_DIR` setting, the `output` argument, and
the "cache-busting" variable we already talked about.

### JavaScript Example

As another example, we can use the [webassets][] `closure_js` function to
combine, minify, and compress two files in your web site's theme, `js/jQuery.js`
and `js/widgets.js`:

```html+jinja
{% assets filters="closure_js", output="js/packed.js", "js/jQuery.js", "js/widgets.js" %}
 <script src="{{SITEURL}}/{{ASSET_URL}}"></script>
{% endassets %}
```

The resulting output will be a single `script` tag and its
corresponding file in your web site's generated output:

```html+jinja
<script src="{SITEURL}/{THEME_STATIC_DIR}/js/packed.js?00703b9d"></script>
```

## Configuration

Being a very small wrapper around the [webassets][] module, there are
only a few options that you may need.

#### WEBASSETS_DEBUG

By default, if Pelican is in DEBUG mode (`pelican -D ...`), this
plugin will put [webassets][] in DEBUG mode, to help you with
debugging. To override this behavior, set `WEBASSETS_DEBUG = False` to
always process files regardless of Pelican's DEBUG flag, or `True`
to always force [webassets][] into DEBUG mode.

```python
# put webassets into DEBUG mode if Pelican is
WEBASSETS_DEBUG = logger.getEffectiveLevel() <= logging.DEBUG
```

#### WEBASSETS_CONFIG

Some [webassets][] filters require extra configuration options to function
properly. You can use `WEBASSETS_CONFIG` to specify these options in a
list of `(key, value)` tuples that are passed along to the [webassets][]
environment.

```python
WEBASSETS_CONFIG = [
  ("closure_compressor_optimization", "ADVANCED_OPTIMIZATIONS"),
  ("libsass_style", "compressed")
]
```

#### WEBASSETS_BUNDLES

[Bundles](https://webassets.readthedocs.io/en/latest/bundles.html) are
a convenient way to group a collection of assets together along with
the information on how to properly process the files. The
`WEBASSETS_BUNDLES` option allows us to make these Bundles by taking a
list of `(name, args, kwargs)` arguments that will be passed to the
[webassets][] environment.

```python
WEBASSETS_BUNDLES = (
     ("my_bundle", ("colors.scss", "style.scss"),
     {"output": "style.min.css", "filters": ["libsass", "cssmin"]}),
)
```

Allowing you to simplify something like this in your web site's templatesâ€¦

```html+jinja
{% assets filters="libsass,cssmin", output="style.min.css", "colors.scss", "style.scss" %}
```

â€¦ into this:

```html+jinja
{% assets 'my_bundle' %}
```

#### WEBASSETS_SOURCE_PATHS

If your raw assets are in directories other than your
`THEME_STATIC_PATHS`, you can supply additional directories to search
in with `WEBASSETS_SOURCE_PATHS`.

```python
WEBASSETS_SOURCE_PATHS = ["stylesheets", "javascript"]
```
